# Story 1

Hi, my name is Marco. I run a small skate shop downtown and I’m juggling floor sales, online orders, and occasional wholesale drops. I used to track inventory in a spreadsheet and it was a mess, I always forgot to update stock after in-store sales and then promised products I didn’t have. With InventoryPulse I can scan a barcode or do a one-click “sell” from my phone, instantly update stock, and the app writes an audit transaction so I never lose track. The low-stock alerts let me reorder before customers walk away, and the CSV import made onboarding my whole catalog painless.

# Story 2

Hi, I’m Priya. I manage inventory for a growing Shopify beauty brand and we get sudden spikes when an influencer posts about our product. We used to scramble to sync Shopify and our spreadsheets, duplicated orders, missed restocks, and stressed suppliers. InventoryPulse hooks into Shopify, ingests order webhooks idempotently, and creates transactions automatically so I don’t have to reconcile manually. When an influencer spike hits, I see sell-through rates and reorder recommendations in minutes and can create a draft PO with a single click.

# Story 3

My name is Sam and I manage a farmers’ market stall. I sell seasonal goods and sometimes get short on fresh items mid-week. I don’t want to spend hours on inventory software, I need something fast and mobile. InventoryPulse’s mobile-friendly UI and quick restock/sell buttons let me update stock between customers, and the alerts tell me when to reorder from my supplier. The import dry-run helped me migrate my product list without breaking anything, and the transaction log is perfect for end-of-day reconciliation.

# Story 4

Hello, I’m Naomi. I run operations at a boutique that has two part-time managers and a handful of contractors doing counts. We constantly argue about whether a product was sold or misplaced and have no clean audit trail. InventoryPulse records every change as an immutable transaction (who did what and why), so disputes are resolved quickly. Cycle counts are easy, staff submit counts on their phones, the app computes adjustments, and we track accuracy over time. The Inventory Health Score helped the team see improvement rather than finger-pointing.

Story 5

I’m Carlos, head of purchasing at a regional wholesaler. My suppliers have varied lead times and sometimes miss dates, so we either over-order or run out of fast-moving SKUs. InventoryPulse computes reorder points using average daily usage and lead times, and flags items that need attention. I can auto-generate draft POs for select SKUs and email suppliers from the app; when the PO is received the system creates restock transactions and updates stock atomically. It cut my emergency rush orders in half.

# Story 6

My name is Leah and I run a popup retail brand while I finish school. I lack time and technical bandwidth but still need accurate stock when I sell at events. InventoryPulse’s CSV import and barcode scanning made setup fast, I imported my catalog, synced a few SKUs for my popup, and used the mobile scanner to update stock at the booth. After the weekend sales I run a reconciliation report and the app shows me trends so I can plan the next popup without overbuying.

# Story 7

Hey, I’m Tom, a small cafe owner. I used to lose money to spoilage and accidental double-selling during rush hour. With InventoryPulse I track ingredient-level SKUs, log quick “use” transactions when menu items sell, and get alerts if a critical ingredient is low. The PO receive flow ensures deliveries update stock correctly, and the import history + batch undo helped me fix a bad supplier CSV without hours of manual clean-up. It keeps my kitchen running and makes inventory feel manageable instead of overwhelming.
